# Card/Bank account manager

A PWA to manage debit/credit cards &amp; bank accounts.

All the data is always stored on the client side so everything is solely under the user's control. The data is also encrypted by a separate PIN (_set by the user itself_).
Support for device built-in face ID/fingerprint will also be added in the future. This will help to open the app quickly **without** using the set PIN.

There is **no way to recover the data** if the PIN is lost/forgotten as all the sensitive info. is kept encrypted using that PIN only.
